# What is this?

A collection of 'private' puppet modules, manifests and templates. However without some 
required files to make everything run. I use this in a test scenario for learning about 
puppet and stuff around.

Feel free to fork, use or whatever there is. Be aware however that things are on a work
in progress base and might change while you're at it.  Or even might not work at all.

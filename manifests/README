Inside this directory a node folder including all the "nodes/*.pp" files is required to make it work. It might contain sensible data, hence not included in this git repository.

A typical node looks like this:

node "server.domain.tld" {

	$sensible_info = "it-could-go-here"
	$sensible_info2 = "and-here-too"

	include class1,
		class2,
		class...,
}
